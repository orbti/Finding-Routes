# Finding-Routes
When the program is ran you need to give two destinations and the max number of segments. See example below.
```
$ python routes.py SFO BOS
$ python routes.py SFO BOS --max-segments 3
```
A JSON file will be geneated with all the routes with the designated number of segments and below.
